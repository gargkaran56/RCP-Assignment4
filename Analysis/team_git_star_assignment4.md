# Section 1

Note: The data for section 1 data analysis has excluded the criminal incidents where the geographic location is unknown. For further information on these geographic locations please refer to the Explanatory Notes and Glossary on the [website](https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/about-the-data/explanatory-notes#Data%20source%20%E2%80%93%20Victoria%20Police).

## Q1 Which police region has the greatest number of incidents recorded?

From the table \@ref(tab:table1), it shows an overview of the total number of incidents recorded for each police region from 2011 to 2020. It indicates that the North West Metro police region has recorded maximum incidents during the period.

## Q2 How did the trend of incidents recorded in those police regions varied across the years? 

Figure \@ref(fig:total) presents the movement of the incidents recorded for each police region over time. 

In the four main police regions of Victoria, it illustrates an evident fact that the number of incidents recorded has reached the peak around early 2016, then has a sudden pungle afterward.

The possible reason behind may be that the large decrease on the number of burglary and theft from 2016 to 2017, according to the report from [Victoria crime statistics](https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statistics/latest-victorian-crime-data/victim-reports-2).

Additionally, this report states that the number of deception cases is in a continuous increase, which may due to the convenience of technology of e-mail, mobile phones and the internet. Thus, it may highlight some areas for re-enforcement in the future, such as cyber security and private data privacy.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:total)Total number of incidents recorded in each police region</p>
</div>

## Q3 What is the trend of incidents recorded in North West Metro's local government areas changes over time?

The observation from table \@ref(tab:table1) triggers an interest for further investigation on the North West Metro police region. 

Since it is the most incidents recorded region, constructing a figure \@ref(fig:north) to observe the change of the number of incidents recorded in different local government areas may provide some insights. 

The figures suggest that there is a tendency that the number of incidents recorded is increasing since 2019. This can provide some suggestions to the government in terms of adjusting the public safety policy and assigning the police resources. 

Yet, few exceptions such as Hobsons Bay, Moonee Valley and Banyule, the reason maybe they are not the major resident area hance fewer criminal activities occurrence.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:vis2)Trend of each Offence_subdivision from year 2011-2020</p>
</div>
The figure \@ref(fig:vis2)  shows

- Theft cases have far exceeded other types of crime in the past five years, especially reaching a peak (about 156,000) in 2016, but the number has declined in the past two years.

- Burlary/Break and Enter (about 38,000) and Assault and Related Offence (about 37,000) rank second and third, respectively.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:vis3)Incidents in each Offence_subgroup of most recorded Offence_subdivision</p>
</div>
The figure \@ref(fig:vis3)  shows

- Among thefts, steal from a motor vehicle has the largest number during the last five years. In 2016, about 63,000 steal from a motor vehicle occurred, but the number of thefts has decreased in the past two years.

- Other Theft is second(around40000), and other offence_subgroup make up only a small fraction.



##  What was the trend of each offence_subgroup found over the years?

<p class="caption">(\#fig:vis4)Trend ofIncidents of each offence_subgroup</p>
</div>
The figure \@ref(fig:vis4)  shows

- Most have seen a decline in crime over the past year, and almost all have seen a small spike in 2016.

- Steal from a motor vehicle in the category of theft has been in the first place in the past five years, with about 50,000 cases occurring every year, far exceeding other offence_subgroups.

- Other Theft is in second place (about 39,000 per year) and Criminal Damage is third (about 35,000 per year). However, the gap between these two types of crimes and steal from a notor vehicle has gradually widened since 2013.

- In the theft offence_subdivision, the vast majority are steal from a motor vehicle and other Theft.

- Of all offence_subgroups, Steal from a motor vehicle in all offence_subgroups, Other Theft and Criminal Damage were the top three, but the vast majority of offence_subgroups were up in 2016, but have declined in the last two years.
