### **Data Description**

The [data](https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statistics/latest-victorian-crime-data/download-data-0) used for the analysis records the criminal incidents in Victoria from **December,2011** to **December,2020**.  It is collected from the [Crime Statistics Agency](https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/about-us/contact-us) of Victoria Government. The copyright is under the [CC-BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which allows the team to apply the data analysis with minimum restrictions on the use of the data.

The ***purpose of this analysis report*** is to assist the policy maker to adjust or re-assign the police resources, possibly providing some insights on the future development on the social security.

In the data analysis, it contains three main parts:

*  To obtain an overview of the criminal incidents among Victoria's **police regions**. Also, observing the changes of incidents recorded over time to seek some trend or pattern in different local government areas.

   *  Which police region has the greatest number of incidents recorded? 
   *  How did the trend of incidents recorded in those police regions varied across the years?
   *  What is the trend of incidents recorded in North West Metro's local government areas changes over time? 

*  To understand the criminal activity better, it will not only show the record changes over time but also the changes of offense sub-groups and sub-divisions. This will provide a precise landscape of criminal activities in Victoria.

   *  For each LGA, which offense_subdivision, recorded maximum incidents? 
   *  For each LGA, Which offense_subgroup was most recorded in the previous found offense_subdivision's?
   *  What was the trend of each offense_subgroup found over the years? 

*  Building on the previous analysis, this part will explore the dissect of criminal activities among different **suburbs** or **towns** in Victoria.

   *  What are the top 10 Suburbs with maximum no of incidents so far? 
   *  What are the top 10 Suburb's recorded with most number of incidents in each Year? 
   *  What were the top 10 Offense's in each year? 
   *  What are the top 2 Offenses for the most affected Suburb's found in figure \@ref(fig:Q1)?
   *  What is the trend of top 2 offenses in each year w.r.t most affected Suburb?

**Observations  from Chart 2**

- In the four main police regions of Victoria, it illustrates an evident fact that the number of incidents recorded has reached the *peak around early 2016*, then has a sudden pungle afterward.

- The possible reason behind may be that the large decrease on the number of burglary and theft from 2016 to 2017, according to the report from [Victoria crime statistics](https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statistics/latest-victorian-crime-data/victim-reports-2).

  * Additionally, this report states that the number of deception cases is in a continuous increase, which may due to the convenience of technology of e-mail, mobile phones and the internet. Thus, it may highlight some areas for re-enforcement in the future, such as cyber security and private data privacy.

**Observations from Chart 3**

- A tendency that the number of incidents recorded is increasing **since 2019**. This can provide some suggestions to the government in terms of adjusting the public safety policy and assigning the police resources. 

 - Yet, **few exceptions** such as Hobsons Bay, Moonee Valley and Banyule, the reason maybe they are not the major resident area hence fewer criminal activities occurrence.

Column {data-height=800, data-width = 1000}
--------------------------------

- Theft was the **most common** crime in each region.

- **Melbourne** in particular recording round 90,900 burglaries in the past five years,far more than any other region.

- Theft cases reaching a **peak** (about 156,000) in **2016**, but the number has declined in the past two years.

- Burlary/Break and Enter (about 38,000) and Assault and Related Offence (about 37,000) rank second and third, respectively, but far more lower than theft case.


Column {data-height=800, data-width = 1000}
--------------------------------

### Chart3 Which offence_subgroup was most recorded in the previous found offence_subdivision’s?

```{r datacleaning2, include=FALSE}
criminaluse2 <- criminaldata %>% 
  select(Year,
         `Offence Subgroup`,
         `Offence Subdivision`,
         `Incidents Recorded`) %>%

  geom_col(position="dodge")+
   ggtitle("Incidents in each Offence_subgroup of most recorded Offence_subdivision")
 ggplotly(criminalfinal3)
```

Row {data-height=800, data-width = 1000}
--------------------------------
- Among thefts, **steal from a motor vehicle** has the largest number during the last five years. In 2016, about 63,000 steal from a motor vehicle occurred, but the number of thefts has decreased in the past two years.

- **Other Theft** is second (around40000), and other offence_subgroup make up only a small fraction.


Row {data-height=600, data-width = 1000}
--------------------------------
### Chart4 What was the trend of each offence_subgroup over the years?

```{r datacleaning3, include=FALSE}
criminaluse3 <- criminaldata %>% 
  select(Year,
         `Offence Subgroup`,
         `Incidents Recorded`)
```
```{r vis4, fig.width=10}
  criminalfinal4<- criminaluse3 %>% 
  mutate(lgth = str_length(`Offence Subgroup`)) %>% 
  mutate(`Offence Subgroup` = substr(`Offence Subgroup`,start = 5,stop = lgth)) %>% 
  mutate(`Offence Subgroup` = str_replace(`Offence Subgroup`,"r crimes against the person","Other crimes against the person")) %>%

       incidents,
       color = `Offence Subgroup`)) +

  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2011,2020,2))+
  geom_point() +
  ylab("No. of Imcidents")
 ggplotly(criminalfinal4) %>% 
   hide_legend()
```
Row {data-height=800, data-width = 1000}
--------------------------------
- Most offence_subgroup have seen a **decline** in crime over the **last year**, and almost all have seen a small spike in **2016**.

- **Steal from a motor vehicle** in the category of theft has been in the first place in the past five years, with about 50,000 cases occurring every year, far exceeding other offence_subgroups.

- **Other Theft** is in second place (about 39,000 per year) and **Criminal Damage** is third (about 35,000 per year). However, the gap between these two types of crimes and steal from a notor vehicle has gradually **widened** since 2013.

- Since 2019,**public health and safety** cases have **risen** sharply, with almost no cases in 2019 but reached about 37,000 in **2020**.

*  **Melbourne** not only had overall maximum incidents, but also had the maxiimum crime in each year.
*  It had least no of crimes in year **2015**.
*  Suprisiingly, **Melbourne** saw a massive fall of 10K in crime no. from 2019-2020, maybe due to lockdown restrictions imposed  during COVID-19.

* **Theft** was the most occurred crime across all the years.

*  Crime rate of the 2 most occurred offences in the affected Suburbs were pretty much steafy along the years.
*  Im **Melbourne**.
   *  **Disorderly and offensive conduct** crime went off radar after 2014.
   *  **Breachers of order** were only seen from years 2015-2019.
   *  **Miscellaneous offence** came into action in year 2020.
